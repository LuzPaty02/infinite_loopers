# Chow Report

## Inspiration
We took inspiration from the Sustainable Development Goals, one of the biggest problems in our city—abandoned animals—and the hard work that organizations do every day, which can be automated.

## What it does
It connects users and organizations to make the process of rescuing stray dogs easier. Users have a handy and intuitive way to report them, and organizations have an easy and effective tool to attend to the reports.

## How we built it
We built the project using mostly Python for the backend and React integrated with Tailwind's CSS library Flowbite for the frontend. We used K-means clustering for the clusters and the Google Maps API for the locations and maps embedding.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble connecting to the database and displaying the Google Maps API.

## What's next for Chow Report
Chow Report can be scaled to all types of organizations (first responders, feminist collectives, etc.) and can grow to be available worldwide.
