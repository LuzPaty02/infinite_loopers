## Inspiration
We took inspiration in the Sustainable Development Goals, in one of the biggest problems of our city, abandoned animals, and in the hard-work that organizations do everyday which can be automatized.

## What it does
It connects users and organizations to help them both make easier the process of rescuing stray dogs, giving users a handy and intuitive way to report them, and organizations an easy and effective tool to attend the reports.

## How we built it
We built the project using mostly Python for the backend and React integrated with TailwindÂ´s css library Flowbite for the frontend. We used K-means clustering for the clusters, and Google-Maps API for the locations and maps embedding.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble connecting to the database and displaying the google maps API.

## What's next for Chow Report
Chow Report can be escalated to all types of organizations (first-responders, feminist collectives, etc.) and can grow to be available in all the world.
